# Notes
## From Matt's PDX event:

> What to Bring: A laptop with your favorite development tools and a unit test framework (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks). Everything else is provided. If you haven't used these tools before, don't worry, we share!

## Why you want to attend from Ann Arbor Tech

• Are you into software and looking for ways to improve your craft?
• Don't get the chance to practice pairing or test driving with TDD?
• Would you like to explore new languages or frameworks?
• Looking for how to find the time to deliberately practice coding?
• Would you like to work (play) with others who have similar interests and needs?
If you said yes to any of the above then 2019 GLOBAL Day of Code Retreat punches all of those buttons! (http://coderetreat.org/)
