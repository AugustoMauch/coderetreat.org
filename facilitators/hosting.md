# What's hosting, what's facilitating?

We're purposefully separating the duties of organizers into facilitation and hosting: A coderetreat is designed as a full-day workshop, and having to do both hosting- and facilitation-related duties throughout the day is very exhausting for a single person.

Facilitation is everything from explaining the format, responding to questions and providing guidance throughout the sessions, so it's a full-time endeavour throughout the whole day.

Hosting means making sure that everyone has the resources they need to get through the day. From power plugs to the right lunch order, a host makes sure that the facilitator can focus on their moderation and the attendees can focus on their learning.

We're focussing on hosting duties in this guide. Head over to the [facilitation guide]({% link facilitators/facilitation.md %}) for more information on the role of the facilitator.

<div class="advice" markdown="1">
If you can't find a second person to co-organize, it is highly adviced to keep the number of attendees low, less than 10. Make sure to not exhaust yourself, but rather focus on the necessities required to make the day work. You can appeal to your attendees to help you make the event worthwhile and sustainable.
</div>

# Finding a venue

Finding a venue might be the most difficult part of your hosting duties. While officies are usually well equipped with meeting rooms, the fact that a coderetreat usually takes place on a **Saturday** might pose extra challenges, as companies might require security personnel to be present.

The company providing the venue should be regarded a *sponsor* and as such be given a short opportunity to introduce themselves. See [our Sponsoring chapter](#sponsoring) for more information.

<div class="advice" markdown="1">
If your venue requires a third person to let you in, make sure that person is aware of the time and that you have their phone number. It is best to have multiple people able to open up in the morning.

There's nothing worse than standing in front of a locked door on a Saturday morning!
</div>

## Criteria

- Central location, easily reachable by public transport
- Accessible (e.g. lifts, accessible bathrooms, level flooring)
- Large meeting-rooms or a large conference room
- Public WiFi (or guest access with enough tokens and without bandwidth limitation)
- Available on Saturday, from 8am to 5pm (an hour earlier to an hour later than official times)

# Registration

We highly advice you to have people sign-up for the event in advance. Both the fact that it takes place on a Saturday, and that it is free of charge increase the likelihood of no-shows.

There are popular platforms for event registration, e.g. [ti.to](ti.to), [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) or even [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/).

<div class="advice" markdown="1">
Most of these platforms don't handle deposits too well. We found *EventBrite*, followed by *ti.to*, to be the easiest to handle deposits and the subsequent refunds. Be aware that you might need to pay transaction fees, even for cancelled orders.
</div>

## Ticket prices

A coderetreat is designed to be a low-barrier event to expose developers to development practices we deem helpful to advance their career. It is neither a commercial, nor a certifiable workshop. The best coderetreats are those that are most inclusive to anyone regardless of their economical situation.

As such, public coderetreats, and in particular events for the *Global Day Of Coderetreat* have to be **free of charge** in order to be listed and advertised on our platform.

In order to lower the no-show rate, charging a **deposit** of up to 10€/10$ (or a comparable amount) is recommended, though. That deposit must be refunded if the person shows up on the day, even if they don't participate for the full-day.

<div class="advice" markdown="1">
A deposit of 10€/10$ works because it adds a monetary investment to the persons incentives of actually attending. At the same time, this also establishes a barrier to participate.

If you invite people explicitly (e.g. by reaching out to diversity initiatives), consider providing them with a special link / voucher code that waives the deposit. This will not just avoid the barrier put up by the deposit, but also underline your invitation.
</div>

# Sponsoring {#sponsoring}

Besides venue and lunch, there are usually no big costs occuring with events. It's good to offer individual sponsorship (e.g. transit tickets) and mention that in your invitation, or having an extra budget for things like Post-It's or Sharpies (see [Raimo's facilitation setup](https://ymmv.craftswerk.io/2018/09/ftt-a-decent-facilitation-setup) for some recommendations).

For these costs, it can be feasible to enlist a sponsor, but be aware that sponsorsing is akeen to an endorsement, so please make sure your sponsor aligns with our [Code of Conduct]({% link resources/code-of-conduct.md %}), otherwise we will not list your event. It should also be said that a coderetreat is supposed to happen in a safe learning environment, so any recruiting endeavours or gamification (such as turning the coderetreat in a hackathon) are a big no.

The average cost of running an event in Germany can be calculated between 10-30€ per attendee, with the majority of costs being lunch and snacks. Sponsors usually need invoices for costs occured, so make sure you keep the receipts!

## Free giveaways

A sponsor may offer free giveaways, as long as they are useful. It is helpful to be absolutely explicit about the exact giveaways that will be provided. Arguably, items like notepads or pens that will be used by attendees throughout the session provide much more value to both sponsor and attendee than, say, bottle openers or branded t-shirts.

Make sure you check-in with your sponsor about the giveaways they plan to offer. 

<div class="advice" markdown="1">
Sponsorship is a trading agreement. You offer exposure in return for coverage of the costs occuring. Your attendees are a valuable audience to any company looking to hire software developers, so be sure you vet and pick your sponsor and the amount of influence they have on the event accordingly.
</div>

## Shoutouts and presentation

It is common to give a sponsor a few minutes at the start of the event to present their company (along with the casual "oh by the way, of course we're also hiring"). This is quite alright, but make sure that you've agreed upfront about the time allocated for this advertisement. Be vary of slides and long company intros.

It is also quite alright to tweet a thank-you message associating the sponsor.

<div class="gdcr" markdown="1">
In previous years, **Global Day Of Coderetreat** gathered global sponsors who's logo needed to be put up on the slides at local events. The sponsorship money went towards charitable causes like CoderDojo. We stopped any initiatives on the global level, but you're free to find a similar agreement with your local sponsor.
</div>

# Food and Drinks {#food-and-drinks}

Running a full-day event **must** involve catering of some sort. Smaller events might be able to crowdsource a lunch buffet, but for less connected groups, lunch is best provided through catering or delivery. 

Per person attending (including host, facilitator and any venue staff), you should account between 10€ and 20€ in cost for catering (Germany, other countries might vary).

## No Pizza Rule

It is important to not serve any carb-heavy food throughout the day (hence the infamous **No Pizza Rule**). Salads or small bowls are usually quite appreciated and don't turn the session right after lunch into a napping session.

Throughout the day, brainfood like fresh fruit or nuts is appreciated.

## Catering notes

Depending on how much time in advance you can spend on this, it might make sense to pre-order individual meals for your attendees.

This way, attendees can choose their meal in advance and can raise and respect any dietary requirements they might have themselves.

If you decide to provide individual meals, a small buffet might still be appreciated.





This list is intended as help for people who want to host a coderetreat:

- Tables and chairs (good for sitting all day)
- Breakfast snack, e.g. croissants …
- Healthy lunch (No Pizza!)
- Afternoon snack, e.g. cake, cookies …
- Soft-drinks, e.g. water, coffee, tea …
- Wifi for everyone
- Power Plugs
- Flipcharts
- Stickies and markers
- Pen and paper for participants
- Projector
- Email a reminder to participants one day before event
- Emergency numbers of host location, e.g. Facility/Security staff


# Code of Conduct



To host a coderetreat:

* Pick a date and time to hold your coderetreat. Coderetreats lasts for a day (9:00am-5:00pm). Because of this, coderetreats are usually held on a Saturday.
* Find a place to hold your coderetreat. Many local tech companies are willing to serve as a venue.
* Find one or more local sponsors for lunch and other expenses. Coderetreats must be free.
* Recruit a facilitator to guide the participants through the day.
* Arrange for a nice, catered lunch. Participants who are willing to come out at 9 in the morning to spend the day coding deserve more than just pizza for lunch.
* Check the checklist for keeping track of things.

# General questions

## What are the basic guiding principles of the Global Day of Coderetreat?

There are several guiding principles:

**Focus on the local events**

It is great that GDCR is a global event, but we want to make sure that each local Coderetreat is successful. As such, we should make sure that our primary focus is always on enabling and empowering the local hosts and facilitators. All things "global" should be considered secondary.

**Keep it simple**

We want as many groups as possible to be able to participate. If we make the event too complicated, we will almost certainly discourage groups from participating.

Additionally, doing more could set us up for a higher chance of failure. Every new thing we introduce has a cost in terms of volunteer time and effort.  We don’t want the cost to become too high.

**Preserve the Coderetreat format**

The Coderetreat format has been refined over several years and works well. While we are always looking for new exercises, we should be hesitant to change the basic format.

**Encourage local experimentation**

Even though the basic Coderetreat format should not be drastically altered, we do want people to experiment and to try out new ideas. As such, we should try to create an environment where anyone can propose and implement a good idea. This applies to both the global event and the local events.

**Coderetreat is for everyone who writes code**

The only restriction is that those who attend must have at least a basic familiarity with writing code. Otherwise, we do not discriminate and we should make every effort to make the event as accessible as possible to as many people as possible.

## What is the ultimate goal of the GDCR?

The ultimate goal of the GDCR is to help software developers around the world (of a wide range of skills and backgrounds) to write better code. This leads to several sub-goals:

* Encourage software developers around the world to practice and improve their craft.
* Teach others how to use the Coderetreat format to help strengthen their local software developer community.
* Support other organizations focused on software development education by raising  funds for those organizations.

## What does it mean to host a Coderetreat? What is a host responsible for?

The host’s role in Coderetreat is very important. Without someone to find local sponsors to provide space and lunch for the Coderetreat, the Coderetreat simply wouldn’t happen. Hosts also help to market and generate excitement in the event.

During the Global Day of Coderetreat, hosts play an even more important role. Because GDCR is a bigger event, it usually requires more effort to organize than a typical Coderetreat.  On the day of GDCR, while the facilitator is busy facilitating, the host helps the group engage the larger community.

## How do I become a host or facilitator?

By registering an event, you're automatically considered a host or facilitator, no registration necesssary!
However, we strongly suggest attending a host or facilitator [training]({% link facilitators/training-sessions.html %}) session and joining the `#coderetreat` [Slack channel](https://slack.softwarecrafters.org).

## Is there a place where I can exchange ideas with other hosts and facilitators?

Yes! Join the [Slack channel](https://slack.softwarecrafters.org) to particpate in discussion about organizing and running a Coderetreat.


----------------------------
# Planning for GDCR

## When should I open registration for my local Coderetreat?

It’s recommended that you open registration one month before the event:

* Opening registration one month before a Coderetreat decreases the number of people who register but don't show up on the day of (reduces no-shows).
* Opening registration one month before helps to generate anticipation and excitement for GDCR. Many of the Coderetreats will sell out on the first day of registration.

## What service should I use to manage registration?

In short, Coderetreat.org is an outstanding place to advertise and announce your Coderetreat. However, it is not a method for actually collecting registrations.

Instead, we recommend using a dedicated event registration service. The three most-popular are [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/), [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/), and [gathers.us](http://gathers.us/), but there are many other registration services. Feel free to use the service you are most comfortable with.

## How many participants should I plan for?

If this is your first or second Coderetreat, we strongly recommend you cap the event to **25** participants. Any more than that, and it could get a little hard to manage. Once a Coderetreat goes above 25, some of the closeness and intimacy is lost. Larger Coderetreats are also much harder to facilitate.

When speaking with sponsors, use 25 as the number of expected attendees (until you have a more accurate number closer to the event).  Most businesses are more than willing to cover lunch for just 25 people.

## Should I plan on providing breakfast for participants in addition to lunch? And coffee throughout the day?

Consider breakfast an optional extra based on the amount of local sponsorship you get. When choosing the order of meals, prefer lunch over breakfast. 

It is wonderful if you can supply coffee (and other morning drinks) for people arriving.

Breakfast typically in US costs US Dollars 100 from Dunkin Donuts. Coffee for all day typically costs around 50 US Dollars.

## Can I charge a fee for the Coderetreat?

From the very beginning, Coderetreat has been a free event. The "free admission" property of Coderetreat is important. In most locations, community events are typically free and we want to keep Coderetreat a community-oriented event. In addition, keeping the Coderetreat free-of-charge makes it possible for any developer to attend.

As an alternative to charging a fee, you could ask participants for a refundable deposit. You can collect the deposit at registration time, and refund it if the participants arrive. 

Collecting a refundable deposit is a useful way to ensure that people show up. It is pretty common for people to sign up for a free event and then not show up on the day. This can be unfair to other people who wanted to sign up (not to mention sponsors, as well as wasting food).

We recommend you use Eventbrite if you plan to charge a refundable deposit. You can either use PayPal to collect the deposit (and then use PayPal to refund the deposit including the associated fees), or you can have Eventbrite collect the fees and then refund the deposit through Eventbrite’s interface.

If you decide to use Eventbrite to collect and refund the deposit (as opposed to PayPal), and you like to keep records of who has attended a Coderetreat, then you'll want to[ export the attendee list](https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-edit-and-export-an-attendee-summary-report?lg=en_US) the night before the Coderetreat (or just before you start refunding deposits). When you refund a ticket in Eventbrite, it deletes the person's registration information.

## I only have a few registered attendees, but the event is still a few months away. Should I be concerned?

No need to be concerned yet. A lot of Coderetreats don’t start to fill up until closer to the date of the actual Coderetreat.

Don’t let a small turnout stop you from going forward with the Coderetreat! You can hold a Coderetreat with about 10 people and still have a good day. In fact, sometimes people learn more at the smaller Coderetreats than they do at the larger ones.

If you are in this situation, then you may have opened registration too early. We’ve learned opening registration about one month before a Coderetreat (September 22nd for GDCR) tends to result in more overall attendees than opening registration at some other date.  That said, you shouldn’t close registration if it is already open. Instead, think about sending out another set of advertisements on September 22nd. See [When should I open registration for my local Coderetreat?](#when-should-i-open-registration-for-my-local-coderetreat) for more information on this topic.

----------------------------
# Advertising

## Where should I advertise my Coderetreat?

There are many places. First, you should list your event on [Coderetreat.org]({% link index.html %})(see the next question for details). The Coderetreat.org website is the central place for all Coderetreat event listings so your event is sure to be seen by Coderetreat enthusiasts.

You can also list your event using an alternative registration system. A lot of hosts like to use [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) or [gathers.us](http://gathers.us/). We’ve also heard some people really like to use [meetup.com](http://meetup.com). 

Finally, you should advertise your event as much as possible within your local community. There are many ways to advertise your event locally:

* Announce the Coderetreat on local user group mailing lists
* Post flyers at your company and at other tech companies in the area (with permission, of course)
* Tell your friends to spread the word
* Talk on a podcast or a local radio show


----------------------------
# Hosting a Coderetreat

## As a host, what do I need to do to prepare for the Global Day of Coderetreat?

There are a lot of things to do to get ready for your Coderetreat. Here are some of the tasks you might need to do (this is by no means an exhaustive list, but it gives you the idea):
* Find local sponsors
* Send emails and tweets to generate interest in the event
* Post flyers up in public locations frequented by local developers
* Coordinate logistics with the local sponsors
* Send reminders to participants
* Finish final preparations such as printing name tags the night before
* And don’t forget to have fun and to create fun

However, **_don’t let this list overwhelm you_**. Most of the items on the list are fairly easy. And you have a large community of hosts (both on the GDCR Google Group and on Coderetreat.org) to help you along the way.


## What are the host’s responsibilities on the day of the Coderetreat?

The host is responsible for a number of activities on the day of the Coderetreat:

* Help set up before participants start to arrive
* Make everyone feel welcome as they arrive
* Register participants as they arrive (hand out name tags)
* Meet and help the caterer who is bringing lunch
* Coordinate video conferences with other locations
* Take pictures of the event or record a short video
* Post updates to Twitter
* Update the Coderetreat Live! application
* Coordinate the giveaways
* Help clean up after the event

As you can see, the host is critical to the success of the Coderetreat. Without the host, the facilitator would be overwhelmed trying to take care of all of these details. **Thank you for volunteering to host!**

**There are a lot of activities for the event being proposed on the discussion mailing list. Do I have do all of them?**

No! This is really important: **_Participation in global events and activities is entirely optional_**. Keep it simple, and only do what you know you can do well. If you feel overwhelmed, then don’t feel like you need to do that extra thing someone suggested on the mailing list.

----------------------------
# Sponsorship

## How can I find sponsors for my local Coderetreat?

There are many ways to find sponsors for your local Coderetreat. Here are just a few tips:
* Leverage social networks and broadcast that you are looking for some local sponsorship.
* Email friends you have who work at local technology companies.
* Ask around at local user group meetings
* Share our Local Sponsorship Prospectus  with any company that shows interest
* Ask in your own company
* Contact some HRs in the IT companies

In general, the small startups or small to medium dev shops tend to be more open to sponsoring a Coderetreat than larger companies.  Thus, don’t feel shy about approaching the local dev. shop about sponsorship.

If you get completely stuck, or if you need new ideas on how to find local sponsors, post your dilemma to the GDCR Slack Group.  Finding a sponsor is a LOT easier when more people are assisting your need for a sponsor.

## How much should I tell sponsors lunch will cost per participant?

The cost per person can vary significantly from location to location and is often based on the strength of the local economy. 
In the United States, lunch typically costs between $10 and $20 per person and often falls around $15 per person.


## I have a sponsor who wants to give away SWAG (Stuff We All Get) or promotional materials at the event. Is this okay?

Yes. SWAG is fun and can help make the day more interesting. However, any promotional materials, goods, or merchandise provided by local sponsors should be in good taste. Items which might harm, offend, or disturb participants must be avoided. Remember, we’re trying to create a fun and educational day for our participants, not to offend them.
