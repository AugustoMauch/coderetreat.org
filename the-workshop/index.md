intro: |
    Coderetreat is a format for deliberate practice of software development. We create a safe-to-fail environment free from the pressures of normal software delivery.
    Participants learn through working with each other, developing their habits for Test-Driven Development, XP practices, new languages, communication skills, and mentoring.

## Why hold a Coderetreat?
Software is challenging because of the broad ranges of skills that a developer must employ to build products. Many of these techniques require rigorous practice in order to achieve proficiency.  Unfortunately, simply building products does not provide a good learning experience, due to the incentives and risks implicit in the constraints of business.  Developers need a dedicated practice opportunity to acquire new skills and hone their habits. <br><br> Coderetreat is one successful pattern for practicing software development.     

## What is a Coderetreat?

Coderetreat is a full-day event for practicing software development.  By repeatedly building an implementation of a well-known software problem and changing partners, developers can focus on and develop specific aspects of **_how_** they build code.
The pattern has been adopted worldwide, such that anyone joining a Coderetreat can have expectations about how the day will progress.
   
  . Unit testing and Test-Driven Development will be emphasized as key practices. Developers use pair programming, and mob programming, and discussion to exchange knowledge. Additional constraints are given throughout the day to emphasize design concepts and practices.

Two core skills/habits used at Coderetreat are Test-Driven-Development and Pair Programming
Apart from that, a Coderetreat presents a great opportunity for discovering a new programming language or a different progamming paradigm than what you're using at work.

## Preface

### Constraints
> Once at chess club, one of the members exasperatedly declared: "I don't see the point in the knights!  Why use are they?"  The master said, "Fine, lets play without them."  After the game, the novice understood how exposed their pieces were without the coverage provided by the knights, and their play subsequent play was much stronger.    


### Deleting Code

### Retrospectives

## Closing Circle
At the end of the Coderetreat, it's typical to wrap up the day with a final retrospective, to give the participants an opportunity to reflect on the day as a whole (rather than the last session) and to   
Some example questions that are often used:

1. What, if anything, did you learn today?
2. What, if anything, surprised you today?
3. What, if anything, will you do differently in the future?

If the group is large, keeping this session "alive" also means keeping it brief. This means that you might not want to ask/answer all three questions.

This is also a good opportunity to solicit feedback about how to improve the next event, though you might want to do it via sticky notes or a white board, as some feedback might be specific, private, or redundant.    



## Other Forms of Practice

Codetreat one of a variety of dedicated practice patterns:
* Code Dojos are of varying length (an hour to full day), and will feature a variety of different programming problems, as they may focus on problem-solving techinques, software patterns, language features, as well as the software development habits.  

* Legacy Coderetreat is a form of Coderetreat that starts with a functionally complete but entangled codebase (such as the [Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) or [Trivia Kata](https://github.com/adi-bolb/trivia)), and provides opportunities to explore ways to safely restructure legacy code toward a more maintainable and extensible form.   

* [Mobretreat](https://mobretreat.org) is an all-day event where developer form groups of 3 or more (as opposed to pairs), and the session constraints focus on behaviors on communication, interaction, and group coherence.

## From Codurance

By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the Coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practising the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

The Coderetreat day consists of 5-6 sessions, each session's learnings building upon previous sessions. The morning focuses on becoming comfortable with the problem domain, breaking old habits and beginning focused self-discovery. The afternoon pushes the envelope by challenging pairs to stretch their skills and understanding of abstractions, modular design and test-driven development.

What to bring:
* laptop (and power supply)
* favorite set of development tools
* favorite test framework(s) installed
