# Tools

## Video conferencing

- [meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si/) is a free, open-standards-based video conferencing solution that allows for a large number of people to be in the same call. It lacks good moderation tools.
- [zoom](https://zoom.us) is a paid for video conferencing solution that offers break-out rooms and can be moderated.

## Collaborative Code Editors

- [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), together with [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare), offers easy collaborative editing, sharing a terminal and even tunneling ports so results can be previewed in realtime. It is our recommendation out of any more sophisticated collaborative IDEs.

## Brainstorming tools

A shared document can be helpful for persistent information, e.g. video conferencing rooms, schedules or even retrospectives. Share it with your participants upfront!

- [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) offers real-time editing
- [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/) offers similar real-time editing
- [MURAL.co](https://mural.co) is an (almost) infinite canvas that can be used for coordination, brainstorming, retrospectives and collaboration
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) (formerly RealtimeBoard) has similar capabilities as MURAL.
- [Etherpads](https://etherpad.org/) are an opensource alternative for collaborative editing.
