                2020</strong>. Join this year and practice your skills, embrace new paradigms and get to meet new people

        <p>With COVID-19 having a severe impact on the availability of on-site events, we're embracing the virtual
            events we had in the past more than ever. Local on-site events are marked with a ðŸ”´, while virtual events
            are marked with ðŸ”µ. We encourage you to stay safe, the map is here to help you find either a local event or
            an event that matches your timezone.</p>
