    <h2 class="h2-main-page">Global Day of Coderetreat</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">November 16th (or 15th), 2019</p>
    <p>For the 10th anniversary, we will promote events that happen either on Friday, Nov 15th or Saturday, Nov 16th.
      Traditionally, the Global Day of Coderetreat takes place on Saturdays, but we also want to invite companies to promote educational opportunities for their employees by hosting a public coderetreat on Friday. We further want to open the event to people who can not participate in events over the weekend. </p>
    <p>As a local event organizer, it is up to you to decide wether to host an event on Friday or Saturday, or even both ðŸŽ‰.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Last year, there have been <a href="/events">{{site.data.events_gdcr2018 | size}} GDCR 2018 events</a> around the world!</p>
