# 10 years of Coderetreat

It's a pleasure for us to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the coderetreat format this year.

We're preparing special things. 

We'll inform about them here and at <a href="https://twitter.com/coderetreat">Twitter</a>. Stay tuned!

On the special occasion of celebrating "10 years of coderetreat", we want to give credit to the many people who have contributed by promoting and taking this idea forward. Here are some* of the coderetreat pioneers, GDCR trainers and organizers of the past 10 years:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">	
{% for contributor in site.data.10_years.contributors.contributors %}
	{% include contributor.html %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

*This list includes only the people who explicitly agreed on being included on this page. If you are a coderetreat contributor and want to be included on this page, <a href="mailto:gdcr@coderetreat.org">let us know</a>.
