We'll install _VisualStudio Code_, a free code editor that comes with a lot of handy features when you're developing _JavaScript_ applications. Clicking _Download_ will get you the "User-space" version, which can be installed without Administrative privileges.

The default options are just fine, you can optionally choose to _Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file/directory context menu_ so you can right-click on any file or folder to open it with _Code_ right away.
