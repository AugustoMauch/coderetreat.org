We'll install *VisualStudio Code*, a free code editor that comes with a lot of handy features when you're developing *JavaScript* applications. Clicking *Download* will get you the "User-space" version, which can be installed without Administrative privileges.

The default options are just fine, you can optionally choose to *Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file/directory context menu* so you can right-click on any file or folder to open it with *Code* right away.
