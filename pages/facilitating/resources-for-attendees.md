Help your attendees with starting points in different programming languages:

* [Staring Points by Corey Haines](https://github.com/coreyhaines/coderetreat/tree/master/starting_points)
* [Corey Haines' Github repo with Gherkin for Game of Life](https://github.com/coreyhaines/practice_game_of_life): Since the [Cucumber framework](https://docs.cucumber.io/installation/) that parses Gherkin can be found for several languages, it's useful for GOL in any of those languages.
* [Kata Bootstraps by Softwerkskammer Berlin](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps)

They can also use an online coding environment like [Cyber-Dojo](http://www.cyber-dojo.org/). It offers 30 different languages, each with at least one testing framework (most languages have multiple frameworks) all wired up and ready to go: no downloading, installing, or configuring, etc.
