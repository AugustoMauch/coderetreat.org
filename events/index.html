                2020</strong>. Join this year and practice your skills, embrace new paradigms and get to meet new people
            from all over the world!</p>
        <p>With COVID-19 having a severe impact on the availability of on-site events, we're embracing the virtual
            events we had in the past more than ever. Local on-site events are marked with a ðŸ”´, while virtual events
            are marked with ðŸ”µ. We encourage you to stay safe, the map is here to help you find either a local event or
            an event that matches your timezone.</p>
        <p>Want to host your own? Check out our <a href="{% link facilitators/index.html %}">Facilitator's Section</a>
            to find out how you can run your own event!</p>

                <h1 class="h2">What's there to learn?</h1>
                <p>A coderetreat is an excellent occasion to practice <b>Test-Driven-Development</b> and <b>Pair
                        Programming</b>, but it's also a great chance to see a new programming language for the first
                    time or to practice mentoring.</p>
                <p>During the day, you get to work on the same problem with different people for 45 minutes each. It's a
                    great way to explore different angles and perspectives, and once you're past the desire to "get it
                    done", it becomes a unique learning experience.</p>

            <p>For this year, we will provide you with guidance to find an event that works for you, both time and
                safety-wise. We advise everyone to take all precautions they deem necessary, so if an on-site event
                isn't for you, we hope you'll find a remote event that matches your timezone.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for the first events to be listed on our page!</p>
