title: Facilitating Coderetreat
---

The facilitator is an essential part of coderetreat. Responsibilities include:

* introducing the day (see [Corey's introductory video](http://vimeo.com/18955165) for an example)
* guiding pairs through each session
* leading inter-session retrospectives
* leading the closing circle

It is the job of the facilitator to help people learn as much as possible during the coderetreat.
There are many resources on this site to help you prepare for facilitating a coderetreat:
