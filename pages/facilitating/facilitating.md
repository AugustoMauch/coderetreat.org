Help improve developers in your community by facilitating a coderetreat in your city.

The **facilitator** is an essential part of coderetreat. Responsibilities include:

* introducing the day
* guiding participants through each session
* leading inter-session retrospectives
* leading the closing circle

It is the job of the facilitator to help people learn as much as possible during the coderetreat.

If possible, [attend at least one coderetreat](/events) before attempting to facilitate a coderetreat yourself.

There are many resources on this site to help you prepare for facilitating a coderetreat.

When you feel ready, volunteer to facilitate a coderetreat!

## Training sessions

Join us during a [training session](/pages/training/) or you can watch the pre-recorded training sessions available in that page.

## The Role of the Coderetreat Facilitator

There is a great blog post by Corey Haines on [the role of the coderetreat facilitator](/blog/2011/12/02/on-the-role-of-the-coderetreat-facilitator/) with some great tips and suggestions for first-time facilitators, as well as a video as an example of [how to introduce the day](http://vimeo.com/18955165).

## Structure of a Coderetreat

Check out the [structure of a coderetreat](/pages/facilitating/structure-of-a-coderetreat/) with details about what a normal coderetreat typically looks like.

## Conway's Game of Life (GoL)

Discover [an introduction to Conway's Game of Life](/pages/facilitating/gol/) which is the programming challenge used at every traditional coderetreat, for every session.

## Activity Catalog

There is [a catalog of challenges or activities](/pages/facilitating/activity-catalog/) attempted at previous coderetreats. Get ideas on what exercises to do each session by reviewing it or checkout [this exhaustive collection of constraints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3idvASFqaEbN2RkNDYyYjktYTlkZi00ZjFiLWFmMDEtNjJhYTBkYzM2ZDlh?usp=sharing) by [Adrian Bolboaca](https://twitter.com/adibolb).
