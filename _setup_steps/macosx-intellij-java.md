Now we're ready to create our first failing testcase. Create a new folder somewhere (e.g. in your *Documents* folder) and open that folder in *Visual Studio Code* using *Open folder...".

`git` has a handy command, `git status`, that will tell you the current state of your project. You can run this any time without any consequence, just to check what `git` thinks has changed.

`git add .` will add all files in the folder (except for the ones in `.gitignore`) to the "stage". We can commit this stage to `git` by running `git commit -m "Add boilerplate with a failing testcase"`, where the string is the *commit message* in which we describe what we changed.

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you just set up your project with a failing test-case and you're all set for the coderetreat!
